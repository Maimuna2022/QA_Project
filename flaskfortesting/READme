I created a webapp that allows a user to create account. Database allows users to be read and updates. 
I used Flask and SQLite. 
I uploaded the code onto Github and used Jenkins to automatically build and deploy a container that runs my webapp. 
I faced some complications to get this working and its still not fully complete as aI was not able to get the database working.
